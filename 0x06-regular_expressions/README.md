# Regular expression

In this project, I learned to use regular expressions (regex) in Ruby with the Oniguruma library. Regular expressions are powerful patterns used for text matching and manipulation. The tasks involved creating Ruby scripts that utilized regex to perform pattern matching for specific requirements, such as matching words, repetition tokens, phone numbers, and capital letters. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in using regex for text processing and data validation in Ruby.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Simply matching School**
  * [0-simply_match_school.rb](./0-simply_match_school.rb): Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression School.

* **1. Repetition Token #0**
  * [1-repetition_token_0.rb](./1-repetition_token_0.rb): Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression hbn with between 2-5 

* **2. Repetition Token #1**
  * [2-repetition_token_1.rb](./2-repetition_token_1.rb): Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression hn with 0 or 1 occurrences of b and 0 or 1 occurrences of t in between h and n.

* **3. Repetition Token #2**
  * [3-repetition_token_2.rb](./3-repetition_token_2.rb): Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression

* **4. Repetition Token #3**
  * [4-repetition_token_3.rb](./4-repetition_token_3.rb): Ruby script that accepp
ts one argument and pass it to a regular expression. Your regex should not contain square brackets

* **5. Not quite HBTN yet**
  * [5-beginning_and_end.rb](./5-beginning_and_end.rb): Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method

* **6. Call me maybe**
  * [6-phone_number.rb](./6-phone_number.rb): The regular expression must match a 10 digit phone number, By a professional advisor Neha Jain, Senior Software Engineer at LinkedIn.
